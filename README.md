## Description
This is an Adobe XD plugin for Tailwind 2, keen on importing Tailwind config to your XD workspace.

At the moment, it only supports pulling the Tailwind colorspace and either generating a set of swatches or generating color assets for your project - albeit very useful in its current state.

The goal for this project would be the ability to link your project's Tailwind config file to pull in your declared color assets/palette.

Perhaps a future application of the plugin could reach beyond color to help designers craft a congruent design system for better development handoff.

## Adobe XD Plugins
Based on the starter project to be available to developers who first create an XD plugin instance in [Adobe I/O Console](https://console.adobe.io/plugins).
